In this series, I will introduce how to construct your own high performance computing(HPC) cluster using [Centos 7](https://www.centos.org) and [OpenHPC](https://openhpc.community) project. It is not very hard to use these tools to construct a usable HPC cluster for scientific research. I plan to post several articles about hardware requires, operating system installation, provisioning system for compute nodes, resources management by slurm.

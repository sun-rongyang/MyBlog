In this notes, I want to summarize the Fourier transforms in quantum field theory. There are three cases Fourier transforms: discrete and finite size case, continuous and finite size case, and continuous and infinite size case. Always remember that once you selected a kind of Fourier transform rules, you must hold the rules until the last moments.
